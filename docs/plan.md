# Equipment Rental Tracking System - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A mobile-first web application to replace WhatsApp-based equipment tracking for a rental company. Built with Laravel 12 to track equipment location, availability, and rental history.

## Current Problem
- 39+ WhatsApp groups (one per equipment item)
- No centralized view of equipment status
- Difficult to track history
- Manual coordination through messages
- Equipment status issues (broken items not tracked properly)

## Solution
Simple Laravel 12 web app with:
- Single dashboard showing all equipment
- Quick take/return functionality  
- Mobile-optimized interface
- Real-time status tracking
